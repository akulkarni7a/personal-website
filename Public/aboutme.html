            Hi, I'm AK.
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
            Growing up, I had an insatiable fascination with astronomy. I was captivated by the large unknown: The new frontier, the new discoveries, the mind bending theories. I’d spend hours pouring over a space almanac my Dad bought me, trying to make sense of such a mysterious world.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was through this fascination I was introduced to a quote that has stuck by me through all these years.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="blockquote-reverse">
            “We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win.” - John F. Kennedy
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I’m energized by the idea that our limitations are our own doing, that the only thing preventing us from accomplishing incredible things is hard work, and the idea that we will rise to the challenge regardless of how gargantuan the goal might seem.
        </p>
        <p>
           Today, I’m fascinated by understanding the world around me, whether it is in a business or personal setting. You’ll find examples of these below and in my blog. Additionally, I’m driven by the idea that I will accomplish my goals no matter how impossible they may seem. The only thing that'll prevent me from being successful is a lack of hard work and grit, and I don't plan on that happening.
